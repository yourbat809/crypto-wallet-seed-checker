## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **BIP-39 Mnemonic Generator**  
  Generates standard-compliant mnemonic phrases using the official 2048-word English list. Supports 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24-word phrases.

- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet Derivation**  
  Derives keys and addresses via BIP-32, BIP-44, and BIP-84 paths:
  - Bitcoin: `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`, `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0`
  - Ethereum: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
  - Custom derivation paths supported

- ‚úÖ **Supported Blockchains**  
  Supports querying balances and transaction history for the following blockchains:
  - **Bitcoin (BTC)** ‚Äî Legacy, SegWit, Bech32
  - **Ethereum (ETH)** ‚Äî ETH & all ERC-20 tokens
  - **Binance Smart Chain (BNB)** ‚Äî BEP-20 tokens
  - **Polygon (MATIC)**
  - **Fantom (FTM)**
  - **Avalanche (AVAX)** ‚Äî C-Chain
  - **Arbitrum One**
  - **Optimism**
  - **Dogecoin (DOGE)**
  - **Litecoin (LTC)**

- ‚úÖ **Fast API-Based Scanning**  
  Integrates with public blockchain APIs (e.g., Etherscan, BscScan, Blockchair, Dogechain) to quickly verify balances and transaction history.

- ‚úÖ **Multi-threaded Execution**  
  Threaded architecture to allow scanning of thousands of phrases per minute with minimal CPU bottleneck.

- ‚úÖ **Custom Wordlist and Phrase Filtering**  
  Use a reduced or modified BIP-39 dictionary to target specific seed phrase patterns or weak/passphrase-protected wallets.

- ‚úÖ **Result Logging & Export**  
  Outputs all "hits" (non-zero wallets) with timestamp, address, mnemonic, and chain info to a local `.txt` log for later review.

# CLI Options and Usage

This document provides detailed information about the command-line interface (CLI) options for the **Crypto Wallet Seed Checker** tool, as well as sample outputs and other important details.

---

## CLI Options

The following options can be used to customize how **Seed Phrase Checker** operates when invoked from the command line.

| Option         | Description                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `network`    | Target blockchain to check. Supported values include `bitcoin`, `ethereum`, `bsc`, etc. |
| `threads`    | Number of threads to use for generation and checking. Increasing the number of threads can speed up the process, but requires more CPU resources. |
| `phrases`    | Number of seed phrases to generate and check. This parameter allows you to specify how many phrases you want the program to process. |
| `log`        | Enable or disable logging of results. When enabled, results will be saved to `results/hits.txt`. The log can later be exported to CSV or JSON formats. |
